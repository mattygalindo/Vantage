#Infrastructure Automation Toolkit
Overview

This repository contains standardized PowerShell scripts used to support infrastructure and security operations across managed systems and services.

The purpose of this toolkit is to provide consistent, repeatable workflows for common administrative and troubleshooting tasks. These scripts are intended to reduce manual effort, improve operational reliability, and support documented runbooks and support procedures.

This repository serves as the centralized location for approved automation utilities used by the Infrastructure and Security teams.

Objectives

This toolkit is designed to:

Standardize operational procedures across environments
Reduce manual troubleshooting time
Improve service reliability and response consistency
Support documented runbooks and support workflows
Enable repeatable and auditable administrative actions
Provide reusable utilities for infrastructure management
Scope

Scripts in this repository may be used for:

Service management and restarts
System health validation
Connectivity troubleshooting
Device and infrastructure operations
Operational remediation workflows
Administrative automation tasks

These scripts are intended for internal operational use by authorized infrastructure and security personnel.

Requirements

Before using scripts in this repository, ensure the following:

PowerShell is installed
Required modules are installed (for example, Posh-SSH)
Network connectivity to target systems is available
Appropriate access permissions are granted
Required credentials are stored in the approved credential management system (for example, Keeper)
General Usage

Most scripts in this repository will follow a standard execution pattern:

.\ScriptName.ps1

Scripts will prompt for required inputs such as:

IP address or hostname
Username
Password
Additional operational parameters

Credentials should always be retrieved from the approved credential management system before execution.

Standard Workflow

Typical script workflow:

Retrieve credentials
Run script
Provide required inputs
Review output
Confirm service or system status
Script Standards

All scripts added to this repository should:

Use clear and descriptive function or script names
Prompt for credentials securely
Avoid storing credentials in plain text
Provide readable output
Follow documented operational workflows
Be suitable for reuse by other team members
Change Management

When modifying or adding scripts:

Validate functionality before committing
Ensure documentation is updated
Follow internal change control procedures when required
Use meaningful commit messages

Example:

Added Adlumin restart workflow
Improved DNS restart handling
Updated status validation output
Updating Local Copies

To retrieve the latest scripts:

git pull

This ensures you are using the most current approved version.

Contribution Guidelines

When adding a new script:

Place the script in the appropriate directory
Create or update the script-specific README
Validate the script functionality
Commit changes with a clear description
Ensure documentation reflects the workflow
Future Expansion

This repository is expected to grow to include additional operational utilities such as:

Service restart workflows
Health validation scripts
Connectivity testing tools
Infrastructure maintenance automation
Device management utilities
Monitoring and remediation workflows
Ownership
